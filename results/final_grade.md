### Report Grade (38.0/50) 

#### TA Feedback 

Technical Approach: MCTS + time control
Motivation for Technical Approach: benefits of MCTS over Mnimax established, but not explained in sufficient detail
Pros/cons of Chosen Approach: Pros/cons identified in theory, but did you actuall find this when you performed the experiments? 
Future Improvements: Future improvements should include suggestions for different approaches to take with justifications for why these would bring improvment.
Language and Writing: Sentence fragments/informal sentences, most of content is implementation detail instead of explanation of approach
Organization: citation format rong, missing explanation of game mechanics (introduction/context), use latex code blocks instead of pictures of code. Well organized otherwise
